## **ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL QUESTIONS**

### **Q1: How does Snowflake Intelligence handle data security and privacy?**

**Response:**
"Excellent question about security! Snowflake Intelligence is built on Snowflake's enterprise-grade security foundation. Here's how we protect your data:

**Data Encryption:**
- All data is encrypted at rest using AES-256
- Data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.2+
- End-to-end encryption for all communications

**Access Control:**
- Role-based access control (RBAC) at the row and column level
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users
- Single sign-on (SSO) integration with your existing identity providers

**Compliance:**
- SOC 2 Type II certified
- GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA compliant
- FedRAMP authorized for government use

**Privacy Features:**
- Data masking and anonymization capabilities
- Audit logging for all data access
- Data residency controls to keep data in your preferred regions

**AI Safety:**
- No training on your proprietary data
- Queries are processed in isolated environments
- Results are generated without storing sensitive information

The bottom line: Your data security is our top priority, and Snowflake Intelligence maintains the same enterprise-grade security standards as the core Snowflake platform."

### **Q2: What's the difference between Cortex Analyst and Cortex Search?**

**Response:**
"Great question! Let me break down the key differences between these two powerful services:

**Cortex Analyst:**
- **Purpose**: Natural language queries over structured data
- **Data Type**: Tables, databases, spreadsheets, APIs
- **Capabilities**: 
  - SQL generation and execution
  - Chart and visualization creation
  - Statistical analysis and calculations
  - Trend identification and forecasting
- **Use Cases**: Sales analysis, financial reporting, operational metrics
- **Example**: 'Show me Q4 sales by region with trend analysis'

**Cortex Search:**
- **Purpose**: Semantic search across unstructured documents
- **Data Type**: PDFs, Word docs, emails, web pages, images
- **Capabilities**:
  - Document content understanding
  - Semantic similarity matching
  - Information extraction and summarization
  - Cross-document insights
- **Use Cases**: Research, document analysis, knowledge discovery
- **Example**: 'Find all documents related to customer support policies'

**How They Work Together:**
The real power comes when you combine them! Our AI agent can use both services to provide comprehensive insights. For example, when you ask 'What are our customer satisfaction trends?', the agent might:
1. Use Cortex Search to find customer feedback documents
2. Use Cortex Analyst to analyze satisfaction scores in your database
3. Combine both insights for a complete picture

This unified approach gives you insights from ALL your data, not just what's in structured databases."

### **Q3: How do you train the AI agent for specific business domains?**

**Response:**
"Excellent question about AI training! Here's how we customize the agent for your business:

**Pre-built Domain Knowledge:**
- Snowflake Intelligence comes with extensive pre-trained knowledge across business domains
- Built-in understanding of common business concepts, metrics, and terminology
- Industry-specific templates and best practices

**Custom Configuration:**
- **Business Context**: We configure the agent with your company's specific terminology, products, and processes
- **Data Schema**: The agent learns your data structure, table names, and relationships
- **Business Rules**: We program in your specific business logic and calculation methods
- **Document Types**: We train it on your specific document formats and content types

**Semantic Views:**
- We create semantic views that translate business terms to technical data structures
- Example: 'Revenue' might map to multiple tables and calculations
- This allows natural language queries to work with your complex data models

**Continuous Learning:**
- The agent improves over time based on user interactions
- Feedback mechanisms help refine responses
- New data sources and documents can be added without retraining

**No Custom Training Required:**
- Unlike traditional AI models, you don't need to provide training data
- The agent works out-of-the-box with your existing data
- Configuration is done through simple setup, not machine learning training

**Example Setup:**
For PawCore Systems, we configured the agent to understand:
- Pet industry terminology and metrics
- Product names (PetTracker, HealthMonitor, SmartCollar)
- Business processes (sales, marketing, operations)
- Document types (technical specs, policies, reports)

The result is an agent that speaks your business language and understands your specific context."

## üöÄ **Step 1: Verify Setup Completion (5 minutes)**

**üéâ Welcome!** If you're here, you've successfully completed the `PawCore Setup.ipynb` notebook. Let's verify everything is ready and then dive into solving the mystery!

### 1.1 Quick Environment Check
Run this in a new Snowflake worksheet to confirm your setup:

```sql
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
USE WAREHOUSE PAWCORE_INTELLIGENCE_WH;
USE DATABASE PAWCORE_INTELLIGENCE_DEMO;
USE SCHEMA BUSINESS_DATA;

-- Verify mystery data is loaded
SELECT 
    table_name,
    row_count,
    CASE 
        WHEN table_name = 'RETURNS' AND row_count >= 9 THEN 'üö® Mystery data ready'
        WHEN table_name = 'CUSTOMER_REVIEWS' AND row_count >= 20 THEN 'üìù Reviews loaded'
        WHEN table_name = 'SLACK_MESSAGES' AND row_count >= 15 THEN 'üí¨ Slack + sentiment'
        WHEN table_name = 'HR_RESUMES' AND row_count >= 8 THEN 'üë• Hiring candidates'
        WHEN row_count > 0 THEN '‚úÖ Ready'
        ELSE '‚ùå Check data'
    END AS status
FROM (
    SELECT 'PAWCORE_SALES' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM PAWCORE_SALES
    UNION ALL SELECT 'RETURNS', COUNT(*) FROM RETURNS
    UNION ALL SELECT 'CUSTOMER_REVIEWS', COUNT(*) FROM CUSTOMER_REVIEWS
    UNION ALL SELECT 'SLACK_MESSAGES', COUNT(*) FROM SLACK_MESSAGES
    UNION ALL SELECT 'HR_RESUMES', COUNT(*) FROM HR_RESUMES
    UNION ALL SELECT 'SUPPORT_TICKETS', COUNT(*) FROM SUPPORT_TICKETS
    UNION ALL SELECT 'WARRANTY_COSTS', COUNT(*) FROM WARRANTY_COSTS
)
ORDER BY table_name;
```

**‚úÖ Expected:** All tables should have row_count > 0 with status indicators showing data is ready.

### 1.2 Preview the Mystery Evidence
From your setup notebook, you already spotted the **Lot 341 anomaly** in EMEA! Let's confirm:

```sql
-- Quick peek at the smoking gun
SELECT LOT_ID, REGION, SUM(QTY) as total_returns, SUM(TOTAL_COST_USD) as total_cost_usd
FROM RETURNS 
WHERE PRODUCT = 'SmartCollar' 
GROUP BY LOT_ID, REGION 
ORDER BY total_returns DESC;
```

You should see **Lot 341 in EMEA** as the top result with significantly higher returns.

### 1.3 Set Up Semantic Views & Advanced Services
Now let's create the business-friendly views and AI services for our investigation:
```sql
-- Copy/paste contents from: 05_Demo_Environment/Semantic_Views/01_Sales_Semantic_View.sql
-- Copy/paste contents from: 05_Demo_Environment/Semantic_Views/02_Operations_Semantic_View.sql
```

**Set up Cortex Services:**
```sql
-- Copy/paste contents from: 05_Demo_Environment/Cortex_Services/02_Analyst_Services.sql
-- Copy/paste contents from: 05_Demo_Environment/Cortex_Services/01_Search_Services.sql
```

**Create Intelligent Agent:**

**Set your context:**
```sql
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
USE WAREHOUSE PAWCORE_INTELLIGENCE_WH;
USE DATABASE PAWCORE_INTELLIGENCE_DEMO;
USE SCHEMA BUSINESS_DATA;
```

**üì∏ Screenshot Moment:** Show the context selector in Snowflake UI

**Natural Language Query with Cortex Analyst:**
Navigate to your semantic view and ask:
> *"Show SmartCollar sales performance in EMEA for Q4 2024. How did the returns crisis affect revenue?"*

**Alternative SQL approach:**
```sql
SELECT 
    REGION_NAME,
    PRODUCT_NAME,
    SUM(ACTUAL_SALES) as actual_sales,
    SUM(FORECAST_SALES) as forecast_sales,
    SUM(VARIANCE) as variance,
    ROUND(AVG(PCT_OF_FORECAST), 2) as pct_of_forecast
FROM PAWCORE_SALES_SEMANTIC_VIEW
WHERE DATE >= '2024-10-01' AND DATE <= '2024-12-31'
    AND PRODUCT_NAME LIKE '%SmartCollar%'
    AND REGION_NAME = 'EMEA'
GROUP BY REGION_NAME, PRODUCT_NAME
ORDER BY variance ASC;
```

**üì∏ Screenshot Moment:** Results showing how the Lot 341 returns crisis impacted sales performance

**üéØ Key Insight:** Link the operational crisis (returns) to business impact (sales variance)**

### **üîç Phase 2: Deep Dive into Returns Pattern (10 minutes)**

**What you're learning:** AI in SQL functions for pattern analysis

**Building on your discovery:** We know Lot 341 has massive return spikes. Let's understand the timeline and extract insights about the failure patterns.

**Use AI_EXTRACT to analyze return reasons:**
```sql
SELECT 
    LOT_ID,
    REGION,
    REASON,
    COUNT(*) as incident_count,
    SUM(QTY) as total_units_returned,
    SUM(TOTAL_COST_USD) as total_cost_usd,
    SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.AI_EXTRACT(
        'Extract the main technical failure theme from these return reasons: ' || LISTAGG(REASON, '; '),
        'failure_theme'
    ) as failure_analysis
FROM RETURNS
WHERE PRODUCT = 'SmartCollar' AND LOT_ID = '341'
GROUP BY LOT_ID, REGION, REASON
ORDER BY total_units_returned DESC;
```

**üì∏ Screenshot Moment:** AI extraction showing battery-related failure themes

**üéØ Discovery:** AI confirms the core issue is battery failures (dead on arrival, overnight drainage, won't hold charge)**

### **üîç Phase 3: Hypothesis Testing with AI in SQL (10 minutes)**

**What you're learning:** AI in SQL functions for anomaly detection

**The Hypothesis:** *"Are defective product batches causing returns?"*

**Load Returns Data:**
```sql
-- Verify returns data is loaded
SELECT * FROM RETURNS 
WHERE PRODUCT = 'SmartCollar' AND REGION = 'EMEA'
ORDER BY DATE;
```

**Detect Batch Anomalies:**
```sql
WITH weekly_returns AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('WEEK', DATE) AS week_start,
        LOT_ID,
        SUM(QTY) AS returned_units,
        SUM(TOTAL_COST_USD) AS return_cost
    FROM RETURNS
    WHERE PRODUCT = 'SmartCollar' AND REGION = 'EMEA'
    GROUP BY 1, 2
),
baseline AS (
    SELECT AVG(returned_units) AS avg_baseline
    FROM weekly_returns
    WHERE week_start < '2024-10-01'  -- Pre-Q4 baseline
)
SELECT 
    w.week_start,
    w.LOT_ID,
    w.returned_units,
    b.avg_baseline,
    ROUND(w.returned_units / b.avg_baseline, 2) AS spike_multiplier,
    CASE 
        WHEN w.returned_units >= 3 * b.avg_baseline THEN 'üö® FLAGGED'
        ELSE 'Normal'
    END AS status
FROM weekly_returns w
CROSS JOIN baseline b
WHERE w.week_start >= '2024-10-01'
ORDER BY w.week_start, w.LOT_ID;
```

**üì∏ Screenshot Moment:** Table showing LOT_ID 341 flagged with 3-7x baseline returns

## üïµÔ∏è **Step 2: The Mystery Journey (60 minutes)**

### **The Setup: PawCore's Q4 Problem**
*"PawCore's CFO noticed Q4 revenue came in below forecast, especially in EMEA. The SmartCollar product line appears to be underperforming, but the reasons are unclear. As the lead data analyst, you need to investigate what happened and recommend fixes."*

---

### **üîç Phase 1: Detect the Gap (10 minutes)**

**What you're learning:** Semantic Views + Cortex Analyst for business-friendly data analysis

**Set your context:**
```sql
USE ROLE PAWCORE_WEBINAR_ROLE;
USE WAREHOUSE PAWCORE_INTELLIGENCE_WH;
USE DATABASE PAWCORE_INTELLIGENCE_DEMO;
USE SCHEMA BUSINESS_DATA;
```

**üì∏ Screenshot Moment:** Show the context selector in Snowflake UI

**Natural Language Query with Cortex Analyst:**
Navigate to your semantic view and ask:
> *"Show Q4 2024 variance by region and product; highlight biggest negative gaps"*

**Alternative SQL approach:**
```sql
SELECT 
    REGION_NAME,
    PRODUCT_NAME,
    SUM(ACTUAL_SALES) as actual_sales,
    SUM(FORECAST_SALES) as forecast_sales,
    SUM(VARIANCE) as variance,
    AVG(PCT_OF_FORECAST) as pct_of_forecast
FROM PAWCORE_SALES_SEMANTIC_VIEW
WHERE DATE >= '2024-10-01' AND DATE <= '2024-12-31'
GROUP BY REGION_NAME, PRODUCT_NAME
ORDER BY variance ASC;
```

**üì∏ Screenshot Moment:** Results showing SmartCollar EMEA has the worst variance

**üéØ Discovery:** SmartCollar in EMEA region shows significant negative variance vs forecast

---

### **üîç Phase 2: Focus on the Hotspot (10 minutes)**

**What you're learning:** Drill-down analysis with Cortex Analyst

**Natural Language Follow-up:**
> *"Show me SmartCollar performance trend in EMEA across Q4 2024. Break down by month and highlight when the problems started."*

**Alternative SQL:**
```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', DATE) as month,
    REGION_NAME,
    PRODUCT_NAME,
    SUM(ACTUAL_SALES) as actual_sales,
    SUM(FORECAST_SALES) as forecast_sales,
    SUM(VARIANCE) as variance
FROM PAWCORE_SALES_SEMANTIC_VIEW
WHERE PRODUCT_NAME = 'PawCore Systems SmartCollar' 
    AND REGION_NAME = 'Europe'
    AND DATE >= '2024-10-01'
GROUP BY 1,2,3
ORDER BY month;
```

**üì∏ Screenshot Moment:** Time series showing progressive deterioration through Q4

**üéØ Discovery:** Performance declined progressively through Q4, suggesting an operational issue rather than market conditions

---

### **üîç Phase 3: Hypothesis Testing with AI in SQL (10 minutes)**

**What you're learning:** AI in SQL functions for anomaly detection

**The Hypothesis:** *"Are defective product batches causing returns?"*

**Load Returns Data:**
```sql
-- Verify returns data is loaded
SELECT * FROM RETURNS 
WHERE PRODUCT = 'SmartCollar' AND REGION = 'EMEA'
ORDER BY DATE;
```

**Detect Batch Anomalies:**
```sql
WITH weekly_returns AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('WEEK', DATE) AS week_start,
        LOT_ID,
        SUM(QTY) AS returned_units,
        SUM(TOTAL_COST_EUR) AS return_cost
    FROM RETURNS
    WHERE PRODUCT = 'SmartCollar' AND REGION = 'EMEA'
    GROUP BY 1, 2
),
baseline AS (
    SELECT AVG(returned_units) AS avg_baseline
    FROM weekly_returns
    WHERE week_start < '2024-10-01'  -- Pre-Q4 baseline
)
SELECT 
    w.week_start,
    w.LOT_ID,
    w.returned_units,
    b.avg_baseline,
    ROUND(w.returned_units / b.avg_baseline, 2) AS spike_multiplier,
    CASE 
        WHEN w.returned_units >= 3 * b.avg_baseline THEN 'üö® FLAGGED'
        ELSE 'Normal'
    END AS status
FROM weekly_returns w
CROSS JOIN baseline b
WHERE w.week_start >= '2024-10-01'
ORDER BY w.week_start, w.LOT_ID;
```

**üì∏ Screenshot Moment:** Table showing LOT_ID 341 flagged with 3-7x baseline returns

**üéØ Discovery:** Lot 341 shows abnormal return spikes throughout Q4

---

### **üîç Phase 4: Unstructured Evidence Gathering (15 minutes)**

**What you're learning:** Cortex Search + AI_EXTRACT for unstructured data analysis

**4a) Check Internal Communications (Slack)**
```sql

    SLACK_CHANNEL,
    TEXT,
    SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT(TEXT) as sentiment
FROM TEAM_COMMUNICATIONS  -- This loads from pawcore_slack.csv
WHERE TEXT ILIKE '%SmartCollar%' 
   OR TEXT ILIKE '%battery%'
   OR TEXT ILIKE '%return%'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

**üì∏ Screenshot Moment:** Slack messages showing support team escalation and battery complaints

**4b) Customer Review Analysis**
```sql
-- Load customer reviews
COPY INTO CUSTOMER_REVIEWS
FROM @DOCUMENT_STAGE/customer_reviews.csv
FILE_FORMAT = CSV_FORMAT
FORCE = TRUE ON_ERROR = 'CONTINUE';

-- Analyze Q4 SmartCollar reviews
SELECT 
    DATE,
    CUSTOMER_NAME,
    RATING,
    REVIEW_TEXT,
    SENTIMENT,
    REGION
FROM CUSTOMER_REVIEWS
WHERE PRODUCT = 'SmartCollar' 
    AND DATE >= '2024-10-01'
    AND RATING <= 2  -- Poor reviews only
ORDER BY DATE;
```

**4c) Extract Defect Themes with AI**
```sql
SELECT AI_EXTRACT(
    'Extract common defect themes from these customer complaints. Return as JSON with theme and frequency count.',
    ARRAY_AGG(REVIEW_TEXT)
) AS defect_analysis
FROM CUSTOMER_REVIEWS
WHERE PRODUCT = 'SmartCollar' 
    AND DATE >= '2024-10-01'
    AND RATING <= 2;
```

**üì∏ Screenshot Moment:** AI_EXTRACT results showing battery, charging, and moisture themes

        COUNT(*) as return_incidents,
        SUM(QTY) as total_units_returned
    FROM RETURNS
    WHERE PRODUCT = 'SmartCollar' 
        AND REGION = 'EMEA' 
        AND DATE BETWEEN '2024-10-01' AND '2024-12-31'
)
SELECT 
    total_return_cost,
    return_incidents,
    total_units_returned,
    AI_COMPLETE(
        'Given return costs of ‚Ç¨' || total_return_cost || 
        ' from ' || return_incidents || ' incidents affecting ' || total_units_returned || 
        ' units, provide a 3-bullet executive summary of business impact and urgency.'
    ) AS impact_summary
FROM return_costs;
```

**üì∏ Screenshot Moment:** Financial impact summary with AI-generated executive bullets

) AS remediation_plan;
```

**Set Up Monitoring Alert:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW RETURNS_ALERT_MONITOR AS
SELECT 
    LOT_ID,
    COUNT(*) as incident_count,
    SUM(QTY) as total_returned,
    SUM(TOTAL_COST_EUR) as cost_impact,
    'HIGH PRIORITY' as alert_level
FROM RETURNS
WHERE DATE >= DATEADD(day, -7, CURRENT_DATE())
    AND PRODUCT = 'SmartCollar'
    AND REGION = 'EMEA'
GROUP BY LOT_ID
HAVING SUM(QTY) >= 25  -- Threshold for immediate attention
ORDER BY total_returned DESC;

-- Check current alerts
SELECT * FROM RETURNS_ALERT_MONITOR;

DEMO PRACTICE NOTES - "The Mystery of the Missing Revenue"

OPENING (2 minutes)
"Welcome to our Snowflake Intelligence Hands-On Lab. Today we're solving a real business mystery: 'The Mystery of the Missing Revenue.' 

Q4 revenue beat targets by 15% overall, BUT EMEA SmartCollar underperformed by 23%. Leadership is baffled because:
- Marketing spent 40% more on 'Holiday Fit for Pets' campaign in EMEA
- Customer satisfaction dropped 15% in EMEA during Q4  
- Support tickets increased 200% for battery-related issues
- No one can connect these dots!

Our mission: Use Snowflake Intelligence to solve this mystery and create an automated detective agent."

KEY TRANSITIONS TO PRACTICE:

1. "Let's start our investigation by setting up our detective toolkit..."
2. "Now let's use Semantic Views to confirm the 23% variance..."
3. "Document AI will help us extract clues from reports and images..."
4. "Cortex Search will help us follow the evidence trail..."
5. "Sentiment analysis will help us connect the dots..."
6. "Finally, our Intelligent Agent will solve the mystery and email us the solution!"

CLOSING (2 minutes)
"Today we solved 'The Mystery of the Missing Revenue' using:
- Semantic Views to identify the 23% variance
- Document AI to extract clues from unstructured data  
- Cortex Search to follow the evidence trail
- Sentiment analysis to connect customer signals
- An Intelligent Agent to synthesize everything and email the solution

The root cause: Battery firmware issue affecting 60% of EMEA shipments during the campaign. Perfect storm of high demand + product issues.

This demonstrates how Snowflake Intelligence can turn data chaos into actionable insights in minutes, not days."

# PawCore Intelligence Demo: Solving the EMEA Revenue Mystery

## Business Problem Setup
**Context:** EMEA revenue dropped significantly in Q4 2024 - need to investigate what quality issues could explain this decline

## Phase 1: Document Intelligence with AI_EXTRACT

### Tool: AI_EXTRACT on QC Standards PDF
**Question:** "What quality control testing gaps could explain regional failures?"
**Query Target:** `@PAWCORE_DATA_STAGE/Document_Stage/QC_standards_SEPT24.pdf`
**Expected Findings:**
- **Temperature Testing:** 2 comprehensive procedures (Thermal Shock, Thermal Cycling)
- **Water Resistance:** 4 rigorous IPX standards (IPX4, IPX5, IPX6, IPX7)
- **Humidity Testing:** **NONE** - Complete absence of humidity validation
- **Environmental Gaps:** **NONE** - No environmental testing beyond temperature/water

**Key Discovery:** Comprehensive testing for temperature/water but **zero humidity testing** - explains why devices pass QC but fail in EMEA's humid climate!

## Phase 2: Customer Intelligence with AI_SENTIMENT

### Tool: AI_SENTIMENT on Customer Reviews
**Question:** "What are customers saying about product performance in EMEA?"
**Query Target:** Q4 2024 EMEA customer reviews
**Analysis Types:**
- Multi-category sentiment: `['battery_life', 'moisture_resistance', 'build_quality', 'comfort', 'value']`
- Issue extraction and classification
- Timeline correlation analysis

**Expected Findings:**
- 90% negative sentiment across Q4 2024 EMEA reviews
- Specific issues: Battery drain in humid conditions, moisture sensor false alarms
- Timeline: Issues escalated October → December 2024
- Pattern: Multiple mentions of "LOT341" and humidity-related failures

**Key Discovery:** Customer sentiment reveals devices from LOT341 failing specifically in humid conditions!

## Phase 3: Root Cause Analysis with AI_COMPLETE

### Tool: AI_COMPLETE for Strategic Synthesis
**Question:** "Connect all findings - what caused the Q4 2024 EMEA revenue drop?"
**Context Provided:** 
- LOT341 moisture sensors trigger at 65% humidity (not 85% spec)
- EMEA climate: 65-75% humidity
- Quality control gaps identified

**Expected Analysis:**
- **Root Cause:** Manufacturing defect in LOT341 moisture sensors
- **Technical Issue:** Sensors triggering at wrong humidity threshold
- **Business Impact:** Devices fail in normal EMEA conditions
- **Revenue Connection:** Direct link to Q4 2024 EMEA revenue decline

**Key Discovery:** AI provides executive summary connecting technical defects to business impact!
